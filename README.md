# Churn-analysis-on-Reddit-User-data

Objective of this project is to conduct a Churn or Retention Analysis on Reddit users in a specific set of subreddits. The analysis involves generating a Retention Curve, which measures the level of engagement of users over time. The process begins by tracking the interactions of users starting from an initial interaction and continuing for days or weeks. The interactions are then aggregated and analyzed for specific time intervals such as day zero, day one, day three, day thirty, and so on. By examining this series of aggregated interactions, the project aims to provide insights into how user engagement evolves over time. It's important to note that the data used for this analysis consists of user names that left comments in subreddits during a single month in 2012, and due to its large size, it is not included here.
