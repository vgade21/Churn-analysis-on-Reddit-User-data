# Churn-analysis-on-Reddit-User-data

Objective is to carry out Churn or Retention Analysis by generating a Retention Curve to measure the engagement of Reddit users in a select group of subreddits. Given an initial interaction, we track that users interactions over days/weeks/months. We then aggregate all interactions on day zero, day 1, day 3, day 30, day 365, etc. The resulting series gives us an overview of how interactions are increasing or decreasing over time.
